# Vulnerability-Scanner

Welcome to our Vulnerability Scanners!

DISCLAIMER: IT IS **ILLEGAL** TO ATTEMPT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES WITHOUT GIVEN PERMISSIONS. 
DO NOT ATTEMPT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES UNLESS GIVEN WRITTEN PERMISSIONS. 

We have 3 scanners that all use different methods of scanning. 

# SCANNERS 
## PRE-PRODUCTION
### Dynamic Runtime Scanner 
~~description to be added~~

The dynamic runtime scanner does not contain the usage of any external website, 
since it is testing code that the user gives it. 

## POST-PRODUCTION
### Puppeteer
~~description to be added~~

This program uses https://xss-game.appspot.com/level1/frame to conduct a form of
cross-site scripting (XSS). 

Website origin:
https://xss-game.appspot.com/level1/

### Cypress
~~description to be added~~

This program uses the website http://hackxor.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/portal.pl 
to test for SQL injection (SQLi). Using the program makes small ‘noise’ on the 
website’s end, which we try to minimize since the site owners did not want a 
lot of noise, so please use the program sparingly. 

Website origin:
https://hackxor.net/legacy

The program also uses a known username and password on the website, 
meaning the program will not work on other websites unless there is a 
username and password of demo and demo respectively. 

<!-- future implementation could be to allow the user to enter a known 
username and password manually like with the website.-->

# USAGE 
## PRE-PRODUCTION
The pre-production scanner does not require any special tools other than a browser 
and code/programs to scan.

### Dynamic Runtime Scanner
[Here is a demonstration of how to use this program.](https://youtu.be/ClIQ_trg-qg)

To begin, enter the PreProductionScan folder.

Then:
1. open the 'CodeInject' HTML file in a browser.
2. open the developer tools on your browser (click the F12 key).
3. go to 'Console'.
4. at the top of the page, click on 'Browse' and select your program. There is a 'test.txt' file in the same folder if you would like to try a demonstration.

Once your program has been selected, the developer console will inform you
if any dynamic runtime functions have been detected.

## POST-PRODUCTION
To use either Puppeteer or Cypress, you must have Node.js installed.
To install Node.js download the executable [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The version used in this project is 16.10.0, but any later version 
should be fine. There is no special options needed to operate either 
Puppeteer or Cypress, so all default options should be fine.

For **Cypress**, you need to install the framework, in a different folder,
then return to this repository/clone to continue trying to use cypress. The 
instructions to download Cypress can be found [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#Installing).

You have different download options; our team used the `>_ npm install` option.

### Puppeteer
[Here is a demonstration of how to use this program.](https://youtu.be/ndCbjIXwr4U)

To begin, enter your terminal.

Then:
1. change directory into the xss-attacks folder.
2. type `node server.js` into the terminal and click enter.
3. open any browser and enter the link 'localhost:8000'.
4. copy and paste the link 'https://xss-game.appspot.com/level1/frame?query=<\script>alert('Test+Relected+XSS+vulnerability')</\script>' into the field.

Once again, it is **illegal** to attempt any kind of vulnerability 
attack on any website without permission. 

5. click enter
6. a chromium window will appear, and the program will run. Click 'ok' when a prompt appears.
7. wait for chromium to exit.

The localhost:8000 page should inform the user whether the website is 
vulnerable to a XSS attack.

### Cypress
[Here is a demonstration of how to use this program.](https://youtu.be/8Prsnk0rtk4)

To begin, enter your terminal. 
Then:
1. change directory into the CypressProject folder. 
2. type `npx cypress open` into the terminal and click enter. 
3. wait for the Cypress interface to pop up 
4. click on the ‘sql_injection.spec.js’ file. 

A new window should appear and prompt you to enter a URL. Once again, 
it is **illegal** to attempt any kind of vulnerability attack on any 
website without permission. 

5. click okay twice
6. let the program run

You have reached the end of the program; you can click on some of 
the tests in the chromium window to see what each test did.
